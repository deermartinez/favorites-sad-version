08 Journal entry: What is the importance of being able to have 
    500 level and 400 level errors in a web application server? 
    What are they used for ? 
    Give concrete examples other than examples provided in class.

    400 is going to be our client side error code. Meaning something
    is wrong with our website our connection. 400 errors could happen
    for many different reasons-you may not be able to acces a specific 
    part of the website or you may not have the right permissions or 
    connections. The most commonly known is the 404, which just means
    that place you were trying to navigate to a place that didn't or 
    no longer exists. Recheck where you were trying to go and fix it. 

    500 is our server error code. As for 500 erros this may be caused 
    by a mix of information. Issues with the server processing requests.
    Maybe there are high levels of traffic. I think of server errors as 
    when I get something telling me I am "timed out". I did not get The
    things I requested before it changed. Something I can try 
    again later to get that request fulfilled. 


    These two error codes are important to us because if we do 
    recieve one it is the first step in
    knowing where to look when something has obviously gone wrong.
